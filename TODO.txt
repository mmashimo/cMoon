cMoon TODO Bug List:
-------------------

[ ] - 'Altitude' does not change with time in Planets computation
[ ] - Planet coordinates do not match known ephemis by a long shot. Test with different apps.
[ ] - Some alt-azimuth computation is incorrect - possibly due to local/UTC time conversion.

cMoon - TODO
------------

[ ] - Next Moon Phase should be selectable:
    [x] - Default "Next Phase" should use current phase and compute next
    [x] - Show upcoming phases (Next phase) after moon phase computation
    [x] - Forward or backward Moon cycles (+# or -#) - using K
>>> [ ] - Compute Current Moon phase from equation in Next Moon Phase computation
        [ ] - Need step-wise quarter phase search
        [ ] - Need 3rd order approximation to get JDE

[ ] - Interactive (with command line processing) of each component of cMoon
    [ ] - process 'gets' from command line
    [ ] - create in-line "help"
    [ ] - create method to do "quick" mode - suppress interactive from command line

[ ] - Function and formats:
    [ ] - Need "Format" in Settings
    [ ] - Moon phase, phase percentage and "days to New" should be configurable precision
    [ ] - Format Date/Time to UTC and local (including am/pm) - Use Settings

[ ] - Command Line processing:
    [ ] - Make sure all arguments work/documented in help

[ ] - Clean up of code:
    [ ] - Add 'CMoon' namespace for all C++ codes.
    [ ] - Move 'static's to AlgBase functions - so it can be converted into C functions
    [ ] - Convert computation portion into C-libraries (use for MPU/ARM c-programs)
    [ ] - Need unit-tests for each computation
    [ ] - Need to doxygen docs generated

[ ] - Get rise/set times for planets
    [x] - cMoon arg - select all or single planet
    [ ] - Show Mean, Apparent and Local Sidereal times (include Hour of Angle)
    [ ] - Convert quad (ra/dec) approximation for planets (possibly involved)
    [ ] - use sunrise/set for "visible" in addition to rise/set

[ ] - Show RA-Decl / Alt-Az for:
    [ ] - Moon at current time
    [ ] - Sun at current time

[ ] - Read list of celestrial objects (RA/Decl) and compute:
    [ ] - Current Alt-Az (for the location)
    [ ] - Rise and set times (for the location)

[ ] - Need EST/EDT by date for UT-rise/set
    [ ] - Auto-compute timezone (struct tm does not have the capability)
    [ ] - Auto-compute EST/EDT by LAT/LONG and date
    [ ] - Formatter for display time : all, (Jd,J2000), UTC, am/pm (12/24hr)
    [ ] - Show JD/J2000 in decimal (current), day:hr:min:sec

[ ] - C-Functions available
    [ ] - check for available C-functions for some of the more mundane functions

[ ] - Access to Ephemeris:
    [ ] - Find ephemeris site
    [ ] - Need to compute the exact time and update with ephemis (find where to get ephemis)
    [ ] - Add array of date/time

[ ] - Need "Observable Object" list (have not designed it yet, but it would be nice to):
    [ ] - Given a list of observable objects, list date/times when is the best time to see them (times for a given date)
    [ ] - Observable objects List should have magnitudes to compute light attenuation of horizon angle conditions, also.
    [ ] - Possible link to Dark Sky Institute's light pollution index for magnitude attentuation, also

Tests that may be useful:
------------------------
[ ] - Compute moonrise [-r] on November 23, 2020 9:50am. Note Moon rises, but does not set.

Test Next Lunar Phase Code:
--------------------------
https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/ - This is fairly accurate - to the program (AMoon::nextMoonPhase())
